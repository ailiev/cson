This is a parsing library for a data definition language - C-Json. This may be
how C syntax would define literals if it could define more things as literals.
In particular, one can define values for structures with named fields, arrays,
and simple literals - numbers, strings, booleans and null. The syntax is
specified in bnfc/JSON.cf, and documented in bnfc/JSON.ps (which is produced by
"make bnfc").

I call it C-Json as it bears some similarity to the Json (http://www.json.org/)
language for defining data, but I it think looks rather nicer.

Additionally the library provides simple lookup methods, akin to Xpath for XML.
Using these, you can extract the value (scalar or array) of any component, named
as a path of member names, in the data structure.

Some example data files are provided, and the test file test-get-path.cc
provides usage examples.

A quick representative example:
{ a = 1,
    b = 2,
    c = [ {x={aa=1, ab=4}, y=2},
	  {x={aa=3, ab=8}, y=12}
	 ],
    d = { a = 23, b = 25 }
    e = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
}
