<h1>The C-JSON Library</h1>

This is a parsing library for a data definition language - <emph>C-Json</emph>.
This may be how C syntax would define literals if it could define more things as
literals. In particular, one can define values for structures with named fields,
lists, and simple literals - numbers, strings, booleans and null. The syntax is
specified in <code>bnfc/Json.cf</code>, and documented in <code>bnfc/Json.ps</code> (which is produced by
<code>make bnfc</code>).
<p>
I call it C-Json as it bears some similarity to
the <a href="http://www.json.org/">Json</a> language for defining data, but I it
think looks rather nicer.
<p>
Additionally the library provides simple lookup methods, akin to Xpath for XML.
Using these, you can extract the value (scalar or array) of any component, named
as a path of member names, in the data structure.
<p>
  Some example data files are provided, and the test file <code>test-get-path.cc</code>, compiled to <code>get-path</code>,
provides usage examples.

<h3>Example</h3>
<code><pre>
{ a = 1,
    b = 2,
    c = [ {x={aa=1, ab=4}, y=2},
	  {x={aa=3, ab=8}, y=12}
	 ],
    d = { a = 23, b = 25 }
    e = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
}
</pre></code>
